<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language1.	 Genoa has a population of 100,000.  Suppose it takes 100 people to build 1 boat, but only 5 people to grow 1 unit of food.  Draw the PPF, with food on the vertical axis.









What is the opportunity cost of 1 boat? _________________________

State the PPF equation (either version): _______________________________________
2.	 Suppose the below PPF represents the production options for Milan.
 
What is the opportunity cost of: 1 food? ______________________  1 clothing? ___________________

What is the PPF equation, that begins:   Food = _______________________________

What is the PPF equation the begins:  Clothing = _______________________________
3.	A) Suppose our country only produces two types of goods, Beer and Pizza.  Some of our resources – our people – are better at making beer and are pretty slow when asked to cook pizza, though they can do it if given enough time.  Others are superior at cooking pizza, but really struggle when it comes to making beer.  Still others are ok at each task, but not as good as the specialists.  If everyone makes beer, we can produce 10,000 cases of beer.  If everyone cooks pizza, we get 5,000 pizzas.  Show the initial PPF.  (Hint: Look ahead to part B before you draw this graph)
















B)  Now, suppose the population grows by 50%.  Assume the new people have a similar mix of skills as the existing population.  Show on the same PPF above the change and the new situation

What is the maximum amount of beer the country can produce?  _________________  

What is the maximum amount of pizza they can make? ________________


4.	 Our country, Fairland, has two products:  Hot dogs and hot dog buns.  Initially, we have a population of 50,000.  Each person can make 20 hot dogs per hour.  Or, they can make 5 hot dog buns.  First, draw the PPF.  (Again, you may want to look ahead to see what change will be coming)










Find the PPF equation:  _________________________________________________

Suppose everyone likes to eat hotdogs with a bun.  Since they want an equal quantity of hot dogs and hot dog buns, how many hot dogs and how many buns are produced?  Add this point to the PPF, label it point A.

Hot dogs: __________________________  Buns: ______________________________

Next, we develop a new technology – a sausage-making machine lets us make hot dogs twice as quickly!
Show the effect of the technology change on the PPF.

Find the new PPF equation: ______________________________________________________

Again, everyone wants one hotdog per hot dog bun and vice versa.  Find the new quantity of hot dogs and buns.  Add this point to the PPF and label it point B.

Hot dogs: __________________________  Buns: ______________________________

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I am a college freshman from Wilmington Delaware studying business marketing. Growing up I never used much technology because I was outside for the majority of my time. However, as I got older I started using technology to play video games with my siblings which became a way for us to bond. Then when I got to elementary school a lot of my classmates had phones and I didn't but my parents bought me an ipod touch which was not the same but similar enough. Finally, in middle school I got an iphone and used it all the time, especially social media which I still use in college. When deciding on where to go to high school I considered majoring in communication arts where I would have to know how to manipulate photos through photoshop and adobe. With some coaching I was able to do some photo editing through adobe but that was many years ago and my skills are not as good as they once were. In college I am taking a class to learn how to program to improve my skills in business. </p>

Then create a data visualization using colored pencils, crayons, or markers that tells the story of you and your data.

  <h2>Everyday Code</h2>
    <p>Kurzwell believes that artificial intelligence is rapidly growing and will exceed human intelligence soon. He goes into explicit detail about benefits of AI such as combining it with human intelligence allowing us to live longer. Kurzwell strongly believes that AI will only benefit us and there won't be many concerns for the future. However, I disagree with many of these arguments because many jobs are being cut and it limits creativity. While AI can be helpful in different situations it should not always be the answer; it is helpful in many cases like studying or adjusting a few things in an email or maybe a sentence is worded awkwardly in an essay. Meanwhile, marketers and artists for example are being replaced and losing their jobs which leads to unemployment which has many negative effects in the economy and limits authentic creativity.</p>

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Code and digital technology impact on education</h2>
    <p>Coding has caused significant changes in the way students are learning in recent years as more teachers are incorporating it into their cirriculum. This change is allowing room for critical thinking, however it is not authentic. While it is important to know how to code for future careers and should be vaguely integrated, it should not consume the entire cirriculum. Although many people would argue that coding is similar to writing and literature, I would disagree. I disagree because because coding is more logical while literature is more creative and allows us to express our opinion.</p>
